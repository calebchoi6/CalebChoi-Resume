        <p class="lead mb-4">I have partaken in multiple internships provided by medical companies to help me understand the business aspect behind handling the exchange of delicate instruments such as medical instruments. However, to this day, I have so much more to learn and am more than eager to do so. I am attending UC Riverside as a pre-business major, with aspirations to earn a spot in the business school provided here. I am currently a sophomore and have already dipped my feet into the world of business and understand the basics. I hope to one day follow in the footsteps of my father, a great business man himself, and start my own business and be involved in all aspects of the process.<br><br>

        As I stated previously, I recently had the chance to experience business interactions at an internship at IntuitiveX, a surgical instrument company that specializes in minimally invasive surgery. A minimally invasive surgical technique allows the surgeons to perform the operation without fully opening the body. Instead, they would use special tools that allow the procedure to be done with as little invasive procedures performed on the patient. This is a revolutionary surgical advancement and is the reason why a company like IntuitiveX, a company that specializes in these tools, is so popular and in demand currently. At my time there, I was able to witness meetings between investors and the company, observe the daily operations of the company, as well as perform microtasks to help the company out. At the end, I was able to safely say I understood how the company operated from a business standpoint.

At the end, I was able to safely say I understood how the company operated from a business standpoint.

I also have other volunteer experiences that have helped me develop my understanding of business and helped me shape the goal that I currently have set for myself. I volunteered at this start up a few years ago and was able to see how a business is built from the ground up. I was mostly there to help get investors and raise money to help fund our endeavors. It was a long and arduous process, but helped me develop interview skills, people skills, as well as become more socially extroverted. From this experience, I was able to build the required skill set to create a business and will continue to build on these skills in hopes that one day I can use them to start my own business. To this day, I am nowhere near the professional capabilities of successful businessmen that exist today. However, as a student, I am making sure to take advantage of all the resources provided for me to help me succeed in this field once I graduate. I am always making sure to attend the business panels held by the school as well as other clubs. I am on the constant look out for internships to add to my resume as well. I am also taking the required classes to put me on the correct trajectory to succeed at school so I can succeed later in life as well.
